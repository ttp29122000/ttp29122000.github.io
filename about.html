                <p> With backgrounds in journalism, computer forensics, and public libraries,<br> Pam’s obsessions with uncovering the hidden stories in data and developing strategic <br> content systems make perfect sense. Writing long-form optimized articles is her other jam. <br> Her Instagram feed is equal parts dogs (don’t tell her cats), waffles, and drag queens. </p>
